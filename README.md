# OPS_Spring_2025
## An optional student-led North Carolina State University class made for Electrical and Computer Engineering students.

## Description
The "Open Project Space" or "OPS" class assigned 3 projects to students which incorporated the OPS kits. Skills that were taught included: reading schematics, coding, and circuit building. This repository documents information given and how I completed the projects. Code Templates and Schematics were taken from the OPS website, but everything else was designed by me.

## How to recreate the projects for personal use
In order to recreate the project, go to the OPS website for the OPS kit and additional instructions.
